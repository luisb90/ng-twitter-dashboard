# NgTwitterDashboard

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.9.

This project connects to the [PubNub realtime Twitter data stream](https://www.pubnub.com/developers/realtime-data-streams/twitter-stream/) using its Angular2 SDK. The stream provides real Twitter data at a maximum rate of 50 Tweets per second. The user can input a hashtag and get realtime tweet count, average tweets per minute, and a sample of the tweet's country codes. For better results, I matched user hashtags searches to both the tweet data's hashtag data, as well as checking if the text included the hashtag word searched.
